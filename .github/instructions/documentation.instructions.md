# Documentation — ICL Playground

## Honesty Policy

- Never document features that don't exist as if they work
- Screenshots must reflect actual current state
- Only show `icl-runtime` functions that are actually published and working

## Cross-Repo Links

Always use absolute GitHub URLs for ICL org references:
- `https://github.com/ICL-System/ICL-Spec`
- `https://github.com/ICL-System/ICL-Runtime`
- `https://github.com/ICL-System/ICL-Docs`

## After Any Doc Change

- Verify `npm run build` still passes
- Update ROADMAP.md status if completing a phase item
