# Roadmap Tracking — ICL Playground

`ROADMAP.md` is the single source of truth for project progress.

## Rules

1. Phases are sequential — never skip ahead
2. Every checkbox is a discrete, verifiable task
3. Check off items immediately when done (don't batch)
4. Update the Status line at the top when entering a new phase
5. After completing every x.x sub-phase: `git commit && git push`
6. `npm run build` must pass before marking any phase complete
