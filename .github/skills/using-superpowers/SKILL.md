<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## How to Access Skills

Read the SKILL.md file from `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` before taking any action.

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill applies means you should read it.

## Skill Priority

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) — determine HOW to approach
2. **Implementation skills second** (code-review, phase-execution) — guide execution

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Check for skills anyway |
| "I can handle this without a skill" | Skills prevent mistakes |
| "The skill is overkill" | Use it anyway |
